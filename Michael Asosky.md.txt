My name is Michael Asofsky. My experience as a Business Intelligence Analyst with a background in
Operations and Data Analysis, has prepared me for a role in the Analytics world.

My experience includes:
Time as an Associate Director with Legacy Group Enterprises I was responsible for measuring and tracking
KPIâ€™s regarding internal performance to make decisions on servicing external clients. Using data
pulled from our software into Excel, I analyzed the volume of work distributed amongst teams in
order to determine workload where resource allocation was needed. In addition, I utilized this
data to pick up on trends showing if incoming work was maintaining, increasing or decreasing in
volume. From these insights I put in action plans to grow accounts with decreasing volume into
stabilized profitable accounts.

My formal training in analytics was completed with TripleTen. I learned how to make detailed visualizations and relay the
data into meaningful materials. The course includes using various software such as, Google
Sheets, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI and SQL. All of these different softwares have data storage
and analyzation capabilities but have different methods and focuses within the world. My having
familiarity with all of them positions me as a valuable asset to have to manage data functions.
